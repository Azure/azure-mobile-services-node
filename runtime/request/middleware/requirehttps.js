// This middleware handler will redirect clients to use encrypted HTTPS if specified
// As Azure Websites sit behind a reverse proxy based on Application Request Routing (ARR),
// the request will look to express as an HTTP request. ARR will add a HTTP request header
// named x-arr-ssl to indicate to the web server that the request was made over an
// encrypted SSL channel. The request protocol is also checked to enable HTTPS connections
// in a local environment.

// The middleware should be registered very early in the pipeline.
